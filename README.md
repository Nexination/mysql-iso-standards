# mysql-iso-standards
MySQL tables with ISO standards and their relations.

How to use:
There are two types of MySQL files, the files containing the actual ISO standards and the files containing relations.
* The standards file names only contains the standard name: "ext_standards_country.sql"
* The relations file names contain the all the standards that has relations within: "ext_standards_country_currency.sql"

The MySQL files are optimised for performance, hence they contain no variable size storage types.
